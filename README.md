# SiteScribe-AI: Intelligent Website Assistant

## Overview

SiteScribe-AI is an advanced virtual assistant chatbot designed to revolutionize the way users interact with website content. By leveraging cutting-edge AI technologies, SiteScribe-AI addresses the challenge of poorly structured and dispersed web information, providing users with accurate and up-to-date responses specific to a target website.

## Problem Statement

The internet is vast and filled with information, but websites are often poorly structured, making it difficult for users to find the exact information they need. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in information retrieval, obtaining current and specific information about a particular website remains challenging. SiteScribe-AI aims to bridge this gap by providing a tailored chatbot solution for individual websites.

## Key Features

- Website-specific virtual assistant
- Utilizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for accurate responses
